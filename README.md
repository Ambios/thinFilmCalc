# thinFilmCalc
@PURPOSE: This is intended to be a simplistic program that allows calculation of thin film thickness
based on user input of 1) spectral range over which the spectrum was acquired 2) the index of
refraction of the material 3) the number of maxima in the spectra. spectral dadt is read into
the program from a .txt file entitled data which must reside in the working directory of thinFilmCalc.
also a library file can be built if custom films including their name and refeactive index.
