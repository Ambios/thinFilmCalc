# thinFilmCalc
@PURPOSE: This is intended to be a simplistic program that allows calculation of thin film thickness
based on user input of 1) spectral range over which the spectrum was acquired 2) the index of
refraction of the material 3) the number of maxima in the spectra. Data.txt is used to save the calculated thin film thicknesses over time while the Films.txt file is used as a repository of priviously used films. the structure of both files are simple and easily editable.
